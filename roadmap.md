## Refactor figure apps
* Dumb approach
** Control buttons inside +page
* Want to eventually get control buttons and CaptureDiv inside +layout
* Or, pass snippets as parameters, possibly with slugs.

## Performance
* Loading skeletons


## CSS
* Figure out why gradient background isn't full screen

## Item Controls
* Standardize approach
* Maybe use context


## Graph Maker
* Standardize CSS with other pages
* Only axes have thicker lines
* Fix Controls
* Drop down for preset behaviors
* Color coding for different variables
* Custom color coding for multiple graphs on one axis

## Energy Diagram
* Labels for states and transfers
* Textbox for state description?
* Customize which energies are shown?
* Hard-code E0 -> W -> E1?

## All
* Delete a given figure
* Refresh a given figure
* Label Figures
* Add new figure
